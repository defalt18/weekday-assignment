## Installation instruction

For this project we require NodeJs (v20+) `lts/iron`. Get it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

This project uses `yarn` as a package manager.

In the project directory enter the below commands after NodeJs is installed

### `> npm i -g yarn`

Once yarn is installed move on to installation of project dependencies:

### `> yarn`

This installs all the project dependencies and places them into `node_modules` created 
inside your project directory.

After the installation is successful, lets move on to hosting it locally

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
